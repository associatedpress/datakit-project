Overview
========

`datakit-project` provides command-line tools to help generate project skeletons from Cookiecutter_ templates.
The plugin is part of the `datakit command-line framework`_.

Some highlights include the ability to:

* Install templates from local Git repos or from Github
* Interactively select a template when creating new projects
* List locally installed templates
* Check whether templates are out-of-date
* Update templates

The Associated Press Data Team relies on this plugin because it fits nicely into a
broader data science workflow built around datakit.

It's worth noting that Cookiecutter's command-line tool offers some of these features, and its developers
are working to add others. Additionally, we primarily support Git-based templates,
whereas Cookiecutter also works with mercurial repositories.

Please be sure to check out the latest release of Cookiecutter to see
if it might be a better fit.
